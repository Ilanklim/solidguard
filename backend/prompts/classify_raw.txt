You are an expert smart contract auditor specializing in vulnerability detection and Slither-style classification.

You will be given:

1. CONTRACT: A single Solidity contract to analyze.

Your job is to determine whether the contract contains zero, one, or multiple vulnerabilities corresponding to the 10 supported categories below.

SUPPORTED ATTACK TYPES (MUST USE ONLY THESE 10):
- access_control
- arithmetic
- denial_of_service
- front_running
- initialization
- reentrancy
- signature_verification
- unchecked_return_value
- unencrypted_private_data
- unprotected_self_destruct

CONTRACT TO ANALYZE
{contract}

YOUR TASK:

1. Carefully read the Solidity contract.
2. Identify vulnerabilities that match ONLY the 10 supported categories.
3. For each vulnerability, determine:
   - attack type (one of the 10 above)
   - severity: low | medium | high
   - approximate line numbers (array of integers)
   - a short, factual one-sentence description
   - refs: must ALWAYS be null (no external references)
4. If NO vulnerability is present, you MUST output "attacks": [].

JSON OUTPUT SPECIFICATION (CRITICAL):

You MUST output ONLY a single JSON object with this exact structure:

{{
  "id": "{contract_id}",
  "solidity": "^0.8.20",
  "attacks": [
    {{
      "type": "<attack_type>",
      "severity": "<low|medium|high>",
      "lines": [<line_numbers>],
      "description": "<one sentence>",
      "refs": null
    }}
  ]
}}

If the contract is entirely safe with respect to these 10 categories, you MUST output:

{{
  "id": "{contract_id}",
  "solidity": "^0.8.20",
  "attacks": None
}}

DETAILED RULES:

- Output ONLY JSON. No commentary, no explanation, no Markdown, no code blocks.
- "attacks" MUST be an array. If there are no vulnerabilities, use "attacks": [].
- Each "type" MUST be exactly one of:
  ["access_control", "arithmetic", "denial_of_service", "front_running", "initialization", "reentrancy", "signature_verification", "unchecked_return_value", "unencrypted_private_data", "unprotected_self_destruct"].
- Do NOT invent new attack types or labels.
- Line numbers:
  - Use a best-effort estimate based on the provided contract lines.
  - Must be an array of integers (e.g., [12, 13] or [42]).
- Severity:
  - Choose low / medium / high based on typical impact for that vulnerability type.
- Description:
  - Single sentence.
  - Factual, concise, no marketing language.
- refs:
  - MUST always be null.
  - Do NOT output links, IDs, or any other reference data.
- Do NOT include any Solidity source code inside the JSON fields.
- Classification must be based ONLY on the given contract and the 10 categories above (no external context).
