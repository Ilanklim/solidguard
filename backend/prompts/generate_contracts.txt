You are an expert Solidity engineer and blockchain security researcher specializing in creating diverse vulnerable smart contracts for security testing and education.

Generate ONE Solidity smart contract AND one JSON metadata object. Each generation should be UNIQUE and CREATIVE.

PRIMARY REQUIREMENTS

Generate:

1. A MALICIOUS contract with CREATIVE VARIATION:
   * Must begin with: // SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
   * Contains 1–3 real vulnerabilities (90% = 1 vuln, 10% = 2–3 vulns)
   * Vulnerabilities must be Slither-detectable
   * Solidity ^0.8.20
   * Under 100 lines
   * No imports, no libraries, no OpenZeppelin
   * Mark vulnerable lines with "// vulnerable"
   * IMPORTANT: Vary contract names, function names, variable names, and implementation patterns
   * Use different approaches to create the same vulnerability type

SUPPORTED ATTACK TYPES (use only these):
- access_control
- arithmetic
- denial_of_service
- front_running
- initialization
- reentrancy
- signature_verification
- unchecked_return_value
- unencrypted_private_data
- unprotected_self_destruct

VARIABLE INPUTS:
ATTACK TYPE: {attack_type}
CONTRACT ID: {contract_id}

JSON OUTPUT FORMAT (CRITICAL — MUST BE FIRST):

{{
  "id": "{contract_id}",
  "solidity": "^0.8.20",
  "attack_type": "{attack_type}",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {{
      "severity": "<low|medium|high>",
      "lines": [<line_numbers>],
      "description": "<one sentence description>"
    }}
  ]
}}

CONTRACT OUTPUT (AFTER JSON ONLY):

// MALICIOUS CONTRACT
<MALICIOUS_SOLIDITY_CODE>

STRICT RULES:
* JSON MUST appear FIRST.
* JSON MUST NOT contain Solidity.
* Only one malicious contract is required.
* No ``` fences.
* No extra text or explanation.
